# About the wireframing kit
Quick sketchapp wireframing tool for UK government digital services

The Sketch wireframing kit provides a simple way to make static prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK. These wireframes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

It is designed around these GOV.UK resources:

[GOV.UK elements](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements "GOV.UK elements")<br />
